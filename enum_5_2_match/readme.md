In my way it is match it is `kind of switch statement`
whatever the input we take we need to define all the variants in the match, without it gives an error

##### Suppose
Option is there which is having 2 variants you need to define what needs to happen for each variant if
it comes as an input

In the same way current example `APIResponse` which contains 4 variants you need to write the 4 cases
